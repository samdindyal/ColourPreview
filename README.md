#ColourPreview

ColourPreview is a very small web app which previews colours in RGB and hexadecimal formats written with the MEAN Stack.

If you'd like to install ColourPreview, clone this repository and from the root, run:

```
npm install
```

Once that's done, just simply run:

```
node index.js
```

and ColourPreview will be accessible through your web browser at http://localhost:3000, or whichever port the console has printed out.
